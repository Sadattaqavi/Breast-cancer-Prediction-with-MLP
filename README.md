# Breast-cancer-Prediction-with-MLP
The goal of this project is to implement an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model for predicting breast cancer.
For this project, the Breast Cancer dataset has been considered.
The features in this dataset are calculated from digital images related to the biopsy of breast masses,
describing the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. For more detailed explanations of each feature,
you can refer to the "Breast Cancer description" file.
